# Cadia Military Framework - RimWorld Total Conversion

## Overview
This project transforms RimWorld into a comprehensive military civilization inspired by Cadia. The framework aims to create a realistic multi-colony empire featuring psychological conditioning, physical training, structured hierarchies, authentic military logistics, and **intelligent AI-driven military behavior**. The system emphasizes realism, immersion, and player-driven control of recruitment, training, combat operations, and supply chain management with autonomous military decision-making.

## Core Objectives

-   **Multi-Colony Military Network**: Establish specialized facilities (bootcamp, supply depots, manufacturing centers, forward operating bases) across multiple world tiles.
-   **Comprehensive Bootcamp System**: Transform civilian pawns into disciplined soldiers through psychological conditioning, physical training, and military indoctrination.
-   **Authentic Military Hierarchy**: Implement USMC-inspired rank structure with unique names fitting the setting, complete with promotion ceremonies and chain-of-command dynamics.
-   **Intelligent Military AI**: Officers and specialists who think strategically, coordinate tactics, and execute military doctrine autonomously.
-   **Inter-Colony Logistics**: Automated supply runs, equipment transfers, and personnel rotations between facilities using scheduled vehicle convoys.
-   **Specialized Military Roles**: Deep specialization system from basic infantry to advanced technical roles (Rifleman, Medic, Squad Leader, Drone Operator, Heavy Weapons Specialist).
-   **Psychological Realism**: Create "Field Rat" conditioning that makes soldiers enjoy spartan conditions, military discipline, and combat environments that would break civilians.

## Revolutionary Features

### Psychological Conditioning System
-   **Trait Evolution**: Pawns undergo fundamental personality changes during training - removing civilian weaknesses (Greedy, Jealous, Neurotic) and gaining military strengths (Disciplined, Field Hardened, Unit Loyalty).
-   **Dynamic Trait Adaptation**: Vanilla "incapable" traits (e.g., "Incapable of Dumb Labor," "Incapable of Caring") are re-interpreted: pawns *will* perform these tasks, but initially with a mood debuff. Consistent exposure and performance of disliked tasks over time will offer a chance for the pawn to lose the negative trait or gain a new, more pragmatic one, simulating adaptation.
-   **Acclimation to Military Life**: Conditioned soldiers will become comfortable with common military discomforts. Mood debuffs for things like "Slept In Barracks," "Disturbed Sleep," "Awful Bathroom," and "No Privacy" will be **directly suppressed or inverted into minor mood buffs for conditioned pawns via the "Field Rat" trait/Hediff**, reinforcing their preference for military living conditions.
-   **Field Rat Development**: Soldiers gain preferences for MREs, military cots, outdoor conditions, and high-stress environments.
-   **Mental Resilience**: Graduated soldiers become immune to mood penalties that affect civilians, with bonuses for military structure and unit cohesion.

### Physical Enhancement & Conditioning Framework
This framework integrates physical attributes with deep skill-based mechanics, ensuring every soldier's body and training are critical to their effectiveness.

* **Dynamic Body Physiology (Integrated with 'Workout' & 'Rimbodies' Mods)**: Leverages existing robust mods to create realistic pawn physiologies based on **`MuscleMass`** and **`Fat`**.
    * **Metabolic Cost:** Pawns with higher `MuscleMass` will consume more food, creating a strategic trade-off between raw strength and resource efficiency.
    * **Direct Stat Impact:** `MuscleMass` and `Fat` directly influence core physical stats like `CarryWeight`, `MoveSpeed`, `UnarmedDamage`, and various work speeds (e.g., Construction, Mining). Excess fat will explicitly reduce `MoveSpeed`.

* **Refined Physical Skills (Strength, Fitness, Discipline)**: Your custom `Strength` and `Fitness` skills represent more than just raw physical capacity; they embody **technique, efficiency, and learned wisdom**, allowing experienced soldiers to leverage their bodies with greater effectiveness regardless of raw mass.
    * **Strength (`STR`):** Governs a pawn's raw power and how effectively they apply force. Influences melee combat effectiveness, construction capabilities, and equipment handling.
        * **`MuscleMass` Cap:** A pawn's `Strength` skill level now determines the **maximum `MuscleMass`** they can gain and maintain. Low `Strength` (e.g., <5) will cap `MuscleMass` at 'Thin' levels, `Strength` 5-14 allows for 'Lean' (Optimal) physique, while `Strength` 15+ is required to achieve 'Hulk' levels of `MuscleMass`. This ensures pawns cannot achieve muscular physiques unsupported by their functional strength.
        * **"Inefficient Strength" Debuff:** If a pawn possesses high `Strength` but insufficient `MuscleMass` to support it (e.g., a Strength 15 pawn with a 'Thin' body), they will experience penalties to work speed, movement, and accrue fatigue faster. Critically, their `Strength` skill will **regress at an accelerated rate** until their `MuscleMass` catches up or their `Strength` skill aligns with their current physique.
        * **Technique Multiplier:** `Strength` skill provides an *additional multiplier* to physical stats (like `CarryWeight`, `UnarmedDamage`, work speeds) *beyond* what `MuscleMass` provides, simulating a skilled application of force.
    * **Fitness (`FIT`):** Affects movement speed, endurance during extended operations, and recovery. Governs a pawn's endurance, agility, and overall physical resilience.
        * **Fatigue Management:** Directly influences the rate at which pawns gain and recover from various fatigue `Hediffs` (including your custom `Hediff_MuscleFatigue` and `Hediff_RuckExhaustion`). Higher `Fitness` means less fatigue accumulation and faster recovery.
        * **Agility & Stamina:** Provides bonuses to `MoveSpeed` (independent of fat's direct influence) and `MeleeDodgeChance`, reflecting overall athleticism and the ability to sustain effort.
    * **Discipline Skill (`DIS`):** Controls mental break resistance, order-following behavior, and stress management under fire.

* **Realistic Rucking System:** Marching with loads now incurs significant fatigue for all pawns, emphasizing endurance over brute strength for long treks.
    * **`JobDef_RuckMarch`:** Pawns can be assigned to designated "Ruck Marches" (via Drill Sergeants or officer commands). They'll equip rucksacks with specific loads and traverse routes.
    * **`Hediff_RuckExhaustion`:** While rucking, pawns accumulate this new `Hediff`. Its severity progressively reduces `MoveSpeed`, increases `Rest` need, accelerates other fatigue, and can lead to collapse or mental breaks if pushed too far.
    * **Skill Integration:** `Fitness` is paramount for endurance and recovery during rucking. `Strength` influences the comfortable carrying capacity and contributes to initial pace. `Discipline` helps pawns resist the mental and physical tolls of extreme exhaustion.

### Advanced Military Hierarchy with Intelligent AI
-   **Rank-Based Progression**: From Recruit through specialized career tracks (Infantry, Medical, Technical, Leadership), **using "Deadman Switch Ranks" as a foundational framework for custom ranks and their benefits.**
-   **Strategic Command AI**: Officers who make autonomous decisions about base defense, patrol routes, and resource allocation.
-   **Tactical Squad Leaders**: NCOs who coordinate fireteams with real tactical awareness and adaptive combat strategies.
-   **Chain of Command Dynamics**: Higher-ranked pawns influence lower ranks through enhanced job priorities and AI-driven military protocols.
-   **Battlefield Promotions & Demotions**: Pawns can earn immediate rank increases for exceptional performance in combat (e.g., saving critical units, holding key positions, high kill counts), and conversely, face demotions for severe insubordination, cowardice, or failure to perform duties (e.g., sleeping on firewatch). This system will integrate with and **leverage the "Deadman Switch Ranks" mod, with custom AI (Drill Sergeants, Officers) actively observing, reporting, and triggering these rank changes.**
-   **AI Observation and Reporting**: **Custom AI (Drill Sergeants, Officers, and Commissars) will actively observe pawn behavior for infractions (e.g., sleeping on firewatch, extended slacking, insubordination) or exceptional performance (e.g., combat heroism). They will then generate reports or initiate specific social interactions (e.g., discipline, commendation) that can directly influence promotion/demotion decisions.**
-   **Specialty AI Behaviors**: Role-specific intelligence for medics, engineers, and specialists who prioritize their military functions.

### Military Training and Doctrine System
-   **Drill Sergeant AI**: Bootcamp instructors who autonomously run training programs, bark orders, coordinate drills, and evaluate recruit progress. DIs will actively observe recruits for infractions (e.g., "slacking," "sleeping on firewatch") and initiate disciplinary actions, potentially leading to demotions.
-   **Specialized Training Activities**: Includes physical training (PT) exercises with specific designated spots.
-   **Combat Doctrine Implementation**: AI-driven tactical behaviors based on military training and rank structure.
-   **Autonomous Military Operations**: Patrols, guard duties, and tactical responses executed without constant player micromanagement.
-   **Battle Buddy System**: Pawns can be assigned battle buddies, fostering unit cohesion. AI (Officers, NCOs) can observe the state of buddy pairs, and sustained separation or loss of a buddy can trigger specific AI responses (e.g., a DI checking on a separated pawn, or disciplinary action for negligence leading to a buddy's loss).

### Instinctive "Talents" Perk System (Automatic Acquisition & Dynamic Buffs)
-   **Specific Proficiencies**: Pawns automatically gain specialized "talents" (perks) that represent ingrained training and conditioned responses, such as "Rifle Expertise," "Advanced Grenadier," or "Combat Reflexes."
-   **Tree-Based Progression**: Talents are organized in a progression tree, requiring previous talents, specific skill levels (Strength, Fitness, Discipline, Shooting, etc.), and **achievements** (e.g., specific kill counts, raids survived).
-   **Job-Specific Requirements**: Advanced talents will require completion of **specific military training jobs** (e.g., a "Rifle Drill" job, "Tactical Maneuver" job) or accumulated time spent in certain military `WorkTypes`.
-   **Backstory Restrictions**: Elite or unique talents can be gated behind **specific pawn backstories** (e.g., "Spec Ops Veteran," "Ex-Mercenary"), ensuring certain pawns have an inherent aptitude for advanced roles.
-   **No Perk Points**: Talents are automatically acquired the moment all prerequisites are met, simulating true instinctual learning.
-   **Veteran's Resolve**: Highly experienced soldiers (those with significant combat exposure, specific achievements, or certain "Talents" unlocked) can gain temporary or permanent performance buffs when facing overwhelming odds or high-stress combat situations, tied to their Discipline skill.

## Implementation Strategy & Technical Approach

This project focuses on leveraging and extending existing, robust RimWorld mod frameworks and direct C# modding to achieve complex AI behaviors and systems, without relying on Large/Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs) for core pawn decision-making. This approach is key to achieving sophisticated military simulation while managing development complexity.

### Phase 1: Foundation Systems
-   **Leverage JecsTools and Community Framework** for advanced trait evolution and psychological conditioning.
-   **Extend Toughness Mod framework** to implement Strength, Fitness, and Discipline skills, and hook them into core pawn stats and existing gameplay.
-   **Custom "PT Spot" & "Perform PT" Job**: Define a new buildable "PT Spot" `ThingDef` (e.g., Exercise Mat) and a custom C# `JobDriver_PerformPT`. This job will have pawns go to the spot, perform exercises (with planned custom animations), and gain XP in Strength and Fitness.
-   **Integrate "Schedule Everything!"**: Define a new "Physical Training" `WorkTypeDef` in XML. This will allow players to easily schedule dedicated PT hours using the "Schedule Everything!" mod for automated pawn assignment.
-   **Initial Military Traits & Acclimation Logic**: Implement basic C# logic to apply initial military traits, and use **Harmony patching to directly suppress or invert mood debuffs related to barracks living, disturbed sleep, and lack of privacy for conditioned pawns (the optimized recommendation).**
-   **Foundational Military Pawn AI (Individual Soldier)**: Develop custom C# `JobGivers` and `ThinkNodes` for a generic "Soldier" role, focusing on essential behaviors like patrolling, guard duty, basic cover usage, and target engagement.

### Phase 2: Training Pipeline with Intelligent Instructors & Dynamic Traits
-   **Modify Miscellaneous Training and Simple Education** to create structured bootcamp progression.
-   **Implement AI-driven Drill Sergeants**: Via custom C# `ThinkNodes`, these pawns will oversee and manage pawn assignments to "Physical Training" jobs (and other future training jobs), providing bonuses and evaluating recruit progress. **DIs will also have `JobGivers` to actively observe recruits for infractions (e.g., "sleeping on firewatch," extended slacking) and initiate "discipline" social interactions or formal reports.**
-   **Talents System (Basic Acquisition)**: Implement the core C# `Pawn_TalentTracker` that automatically checks for and applies talents based on initial skill, trait, and basic job completion requirements. Unlocked talents will apply their effects via specific `Hediffs`.
-   **Dynamic Trait System (Base Implementation)**: Develop a centralized `PawnComp` or `GameComponent` to monitor pawn activity. This component, based on XML-defined rules, will check for consistent performance of disliked work types (e.g., hauling for "Incapable of Dumb Labor" pawns) and roll a chance for trait removal or gain, generating appropriate `Letters` or `Tales`.
-   **Create trait removal/addition events** triggered by training milestones and instructor assessments.
-   **Develop custom military traits** that override civilian mood penalties and integrate with AI behavior.

### Phase 3: Logistics and Tactical Operations & Advanced Ranks
-   **Utilize Vehicle Framework and Better Pawn Control** for automated supply convoy systems.
-   **Integrate Combat Extended equipment systems** with rank-based loadout assignments and AI tactical preferences.
-   **Leverage "Deadman Switch Ranks":** Implement a custom "Deadman Switch Ranks Expanded" system that uses DSR as a base. Our C# AI will provide dynamic triggers for promotion/demotion based on observed pawn actions (combat performance, insubordination, loyalty, discipline), **with AI Observation and Reporting being central to these triggers.**
-   **Develop multi-colony coordination** using faction mechanics, scheduled events, and custom C# strategic AI command decisions.
-   **Implement intelligent patrol systems** with AI-driven route planning and threat assessment.

### Phase 4: Advanced Military Intelligence & Specialization
-   **Advanced Talents Implementation**: Expand the "Talents" system with C# logic to incorporate more complex requirements like kill counts, raid survival, specific job durations, and backstory checks. Implement sophisticated effects via Harmony patching for fine-grained control over pawn behavior (e.g., faster reactions, optimal cover selection for specific situations, weapon-specific handling).
-   **Semi-autonomous Squad Behaviors**: Through integrated custom C# AI and Colony Survival Logic, implement advanced tactical behaviors for fireteams and platoons, including a battle buddy system where AI considers their buddy's state.
-   **Strategic Command AI**: Via global C# scripts, implement high-level military decision-making for base-level strategy, resource prioritization, and response to external threats.
-   **Interaction-Driven AI Triggers**: Integrate with or extend the "Interaction Bubbles" framework. Custom AI (DIs, Officers, Commissars) will initiate specialized social interactions (e.g., "Discipline Yell," "Moral Inspection"). These interactions will dynamically influence mood, skill gain (especially Discipline), and trigger conditional trait changes (e.g., positive interactions with leaders might enhance "Unit Loyalty").
-   **Advanced equipment systems** using Exosuit Framework for specialized roles with role-specific AI.
-   **Performance optimization** for 100+ total pawns with complex AI behaviors distributed across multiple colonies.
