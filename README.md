Overview
This project transforms RimWorld into a comprehensive military civilization inspired by Cadia and the Helldivers universe. The framework creates a realistic multi-colony empire featuring psychological conditioning, physical training, structured hierarchies, and authentic military logistics. The system emphasizes realism, immersion, and player-driven control of recruitment, training, combat operations, and supply chain management.
Core Objectives

Multi-Colony Military Network: Establish specialized facilities (bootcamp, supply depots, manufacturing centers, forward operating bases) across multiple world tiles
Comprehensive Bootcamp System: Transform civilian pawns into disciplined soldiers through psychological conditioning, physical training, and military indoctrination
Authentic Military Hierarchy: Implement USMC-inspired rank structure with unique names fitting the setting, complete with promotion ceremonies and chain-of-command dynamics
Inter-Colony Logistics: Automated supply runs, equipment transfers, and personnel rotations between facilities using scheduled vehicle convoys
Specialized Military Roles: Deep specialization system from basic infantry to advanced technical roles (Rifleman, Medic, Squad Leader, Drone Operator, Heavy Weapons Specialist)
Psychological Realism: Create "Field Rat" conditioning that makes soldiers enjoy spartan conditions, military discipline, and combat environments that would break civilians

Revolutionary Features
Psychological Conditioning System

Trait Evolution: Pawns undergo fundamental personality changes during training - removing civilian weaknesses (Greedy, Jealous, Neurotic) and gaining military strengths (Disciplined, Field Hardened, Unit Loyalty)
Field Rat Development: Soldiers gain preferences for MREs, military cots, outdoor conditions, and high-stress environments
Mental Resilience: Graduated soldiers become immune to mood penalties that affect civilians, with bonuses for military structure and unit cohesion

Physical Enhancement Framework

Fitness Skill: Affects movement speed, carry capacity, and endurance during extended operations
Strength Skill: Influences melee combat effectiveness, construction capabilities, and equipment handling
Discipline Skill: Controls mental break resistance, order-following behavior, and stress management under fire

Advanced Military Hierarchy

Rank-Based Progression: From Recruit through specialized career tracks (Infantry, Medical, Technical, Leadership)
Promotion Ceremonies: Formal events that boost morale and mark career milestones
Chain of Command: Higher-ranked pawns influence lower ranks through enhanced job priorities and social dynamics
Specialty Assignments: Role-specific training paths that unlock unique equipment and abilities

Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation Systems

Leverage JecsTools and Community Framework for advanced trait evolution and psychological conditioning
Extend Toughness Skill Mod framework to implement Fitness, Strength, and Discipline skills
Integrate Dead Man's Switch AI behaviors with custom military traits and rank structures

Phase 2: Training Pipeline

Modify Miscellaneous Training and Simple Education to create structured bootcamp progression
Implement trait removal/addition events triggered by training milestones
Create custom military traits that override civilian mood penalties and preferences

Phase 3: Logistics and Operations

Utilize Vehicle Framework and Better Pawn Control for automated supply convoy systems
Integrate Combat Extended equipment systems with rank-based loadout assignments
Develop multi-colony coordination using faction mechanics and scheduled events

Phase 4: Advanced Features

Semi-autonomous squad behaviors through Colony Survival Logic integration
Advanced equipment systems using Exosuit Framework for specialized roles
Performance optimization for 100+ total pawns distributed across multiple colonies

Technical Architecture
Core Mod Dependencies

JecsTools - Foundation for custom abilities and advanced trait systems
Community Framework - Complex pawn behavior modification and psychological conditioning
Dead Man's Switch Suite - Advanced AI behaviors and military unit mechanics
Combat Extended - Realistic combat mechanics and equipment systems
Vehicle Framework - Inter-colony transport and logistics
Vanilla Traits Expanded - Base trait system for military personality development

Performance Considerations

Maximum 50 pawns per map to maintain stability
Distributed population across specialized facility maps
Automated systems to reduce micromanagement overhead
Performance optimization mods integrated for large-scale operations

Long-Term Vision
Operational Empire

Recruitment Centers: Continuous intake and processing of civilian populations
Training Facilities: Specialized bootcamps for different military career tracks
Manufacturing Hubs: Automated production of military equipment and supplies
Forward Bases: Combat-ready outposts for territorial expansion and defense
Command Structure: AI-assisted coordination between all facilities

Realistic Military Culture

Pawns who genuinely prefer military life over civilian comfort
Natural adaptation to harsh conditions and high-stress environments
Unit loyalty and esprit de corps that affects combat effectiveness
Career progression that creates meaningful specialization and expertise

Strategic Gameplay

Resource allocation between expansion, training, and equipment
Tactical decision-making for colony placement and specialization
Long-term planning for recruitment, training pipelines, and operational readiness
Emergent storytelling through military campaigns and unit histories

Development Philosophy

Modification over Creation: Extend and patch existing robust mods rather than building systems from scratch
Psychological Realism: Simulate actual military conditioning and adaptation processes
Modular Design: Independent systems that can be developed and tested separately
Performance Conscious: Scalable architecture that maintains game stability
Authentic Military Experience: Draw from real military structure, training, and culture

Notes for Implementation

Focus on XML-based trait definitions and event systems where possible
Utilize existing mod frameworks (JecsTools, Community Framework) for complex behaviors
Maintain compatibility with Combat Extended and Vehicle Framework ecosystems
Design for gradual rollout - each phase should be playable independently
Prioritize psychological conditioning system as the foundation for all other features
